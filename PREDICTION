The following is a sample machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product based on their demographics and browsing history on a website.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product based on their demographics and browsing history on a website. This will help the company to target their marketing efforts towards those customers who are most likely to purchase their product.

Data:

The dataset consists of two tables â€“ customer demographics and browsing history. The demographic table contains information such as age, gender, income, and education level of the customers. The browsing history table contains information about the pages viewed by the customers on the website.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The data is cleaned by removing null values and adjusting the format of the data so that it is ready for analysis. The demographic data and the browsing history data are merged into one table.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is conducted to understand the patterns and relationships in the data. This includes analyzing the distribution, correlation, and visualization of the data.

Feature Selection: The most relevant features are selected using various techniques such as correlation and recursive feature elimination.

Model Building: The model is built using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and neural networks. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated based on various performance metric such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The hyperparameters of the model are tuned to optimize the performance of the model.

Results:

After the model building, evaluation, and tuning, the model is able to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product with an accuracy of 85%. The most important features for the prediction are age, income, and browsing history. The marketing team can use this model to target their marketing efforts towards those customers who are most likely to purchase their product.
